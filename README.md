A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. 

Our task was to:

2. Get a complete list of candidates who recieved votes. 
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate recieved.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
