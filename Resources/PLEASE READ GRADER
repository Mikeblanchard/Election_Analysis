So i had initially saved the .csv file in the main folder, and i could run the PyPoll_Challenge by removing the Resources folder in this line:

  # Add a variable to load a file from a path.
  file_to_load = os.path.join("Resources/election_results.csv")
    
 then i wanted to put it in the Resource folder as it's supposed to be, but i think i messed up by cutting andd pasting some of my code directly into github and uploading some
 others via BASH.
 
 Then i started getting errors.

and keept getting 400 errors when trying to save the .csv directly into github.

after trying for hours and getting error messages, I will have to submit as is. But i assure you it did run at a point, and thats how i got the images and .txt file.
